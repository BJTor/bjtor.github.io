## Ben Tordoff

_Software engineer and manager at MathWorks_

I am currently working at MathWorks UK leading a team focussed on accelerating and scaling up mathematical algorithms to run in parallel on [GPUs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/gpu-computing.html), [distributed across a cluster](https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/distributed-arrays.html), and for [Big Data](https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/tall-arrays-and-mapreduce.html). Prior to that I spent five years at MathWorks working as a technical consultant helping MathWorks' customers around the UK and Europe to solve problems in a wide range of fields from financial bond markets to coastal erosion, from knee X-rays to aerodynamics, and more.
